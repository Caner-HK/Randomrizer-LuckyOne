- **Dynamic Number Setting**: Easily set the total number of participants and the number of people to be selected. 🔢
- **Progress and Loading Indicators**: Visual indicators show progress as the selection is being made. The process ensures transparency and excitement. ⏳

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with a clean, intuitive UI using Material Design, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. 📱💻
