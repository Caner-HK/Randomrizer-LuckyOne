## Features ✨

- **Random Participant Selection**: Quickly select a random number of participants from a set of numbers (e.g., 1 to 42). 🎲
- **Exclusion List**: Allows you to exclude specific participants from the random selection. This helps in ensuring that certain individuals are not selected for specific activities (e.g., already selected or unavailable). 🚫
- **Dynamic Number Setting**: Easily set the total number of participants and the number of people to be selected. 🔢
- **Progress and Loading Indicators**: Visual indicators show progress as the selection is being made. The process ensures transparency and excitement. ⏳
- **Save Results**: After the selection, you can download the results in a neatly formatted HTML file, making it easy to share or reference later. 💾
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with a clean, intuitive UI using Material Design, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. 📱💻

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Set Total Participants**: Specify the total number of participants in your activity (e.g., 1 to 42). 📊
2. **Exclude Participants**: If necessary, select specific numbers to exclude from the draw. This is helpful if you want to skip certain people (e.g., someone already chosen). ❌
3. **Select Number of Winners**: Choose how many participants you'd like to randomly select. 🎉
4. **Start the Draw**: Click "Start" to initiate the random selection process. The app will show a fun animation as it randomly selects the winners. 🌀
5. **Download Results**: After the draw, you can download the results in an HTML file for easy sharing and record-keeping. 📂
